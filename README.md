# Bank Account System

## Overview

The **Bank Account System** is a simple Java-based application that simulates basic banking operations. This system allows users to create a new bank account, deposit money, withdraw funds, and view their account details. The application is designed with object-oriented principles, demonstrating how to manage user accounts and perform basic transactions securely and efficiently.

### Features
- **Account Creation**: Users can create a new bank account with an initial deposit.
- **Balance Overview**: View the current balance of the account.
- **Deposit Functionality**: Allows users to deposit money into their account.
- **Withdrawal Functionality**: Allows users to withdraw money from their account, with sufficient balance validation.
- **Transaction History**: Although not implemented in the base version, the system can be easily extended to track transactions.

### Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core programming language used for implementing the system.
- **Console-based UI**: The user interface is command-line based, providing an easy-to-use interaction for users to perform actions.

- **`lib/`**: External libraries or dependencies (if any).
- **`bin/`**: Contains compiled `.class` files.

> Custom folder structures can be modified through `.vscode/settings.json` for better organization.

### Dependency Management
The system is built using pure Java, with no external libraries or dependencies. However, if you wish to add additional functionality or libraries, manage them via the **`JAVA PROJECTS`** view in Visual Studio Code.
